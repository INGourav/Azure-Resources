AKS Architecture

Azure AKS cluster control Plane : -
1) etcd - Key Value store for stroing all cluster data, it stores all the master and worker node information
2) kube-scheduler - Distributing container to multiple nodes
3) kube-apiserver - everything in kube talks using this
4) AKS kube controller manager - controller are responsible when container goes down, there are many controller

Azure AKS Node Pools : -
1) kublet - kublet is the agent that runs on every container, this talks to kube-scheduler
2) kube-proxy - It is a n/w proxy that maintans the n/w flow.


Creation on AKS cluster in Azure

Earlier, if we set resource identity to Service principal then we can't create container registry in Azure.
Now this selection has been removed and system-assigned identity is only available, to use service principal we should create using Azure CLI.

Networking,
The kubenet networking plug-in creates a new VNet for your cluster using default values.
The Azure CNI networking plug-in allows clusters to use a new or existing VNet with customizable addresses. Application pods are connected directly to the VNet, which allows for native integration with VNet features.


Create credentials for AKS to access using CLI

Login to az shell and run below command,
az aks get-credentials --resource-group <rg name> --name <cluster name>

Check info of AKS after credential,
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get nodes -o wide "This will give more info like IP, OS Image"
