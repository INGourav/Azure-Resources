#  MSIX - https://www.stephanvdkruis.com/category/microsoft/azure/

Note : - If we associate one app group to a workspace then all AG those are attached to same hostpool must be attached to that workspace.
      VM should be domain joined (No wrokaround for this)
	  Reverse connect (TCP) works behind the WVD for connection however we can also use RDP shortpath (UDP) on port 3390. We also have to make chnages in registry to use RDP shortpath.

1 - First, in Azure Active Directory, we built a custom domain.
2 - Verify this in domain provider
3 - Create a VM and promte this as a DC
4 - Propogat custom DNS to VNET
5 - Create a workspace (Place the workspace in another rg for better management and life-cycle)
6 - Create a hostpool and Virtual machine inside it (VM can be created after the hostpool also Hostpool and VM can be in different location)
   There are two option in session host creation BFS and DFS (Max user default limit is 99999)
7 - Assign rights on application groups (create a single group for all WVD users and single group for all similar kinda users) ( For ad sync, use Start-adsyncsynccycle; else, ad sync will take 30 minutes.)

#URL to login : - https://rdweb.wvd.microsoft.com/webclient/index.html
                  https://rdweb.wvd.microsoft.com/arm/webclient/index.html

              httsps://rdweb.wvd.microsoft.coom/api/arm/feeddiscovery

Note : - 
It will sync onmicrosoft.com users if the primary domain is not defined in Azure AD or if the domain name is misspelt during user creation.
To terminate connection requests, we can utilise drain mode in the session host (VM).

8 - Create new application group (remote application) assign the users to this app group and add appliction from Start menu, File Path, MSIX.
9 - Configure Azure file/Storage account
    Create an OU and GPO to block password expiration
	Create the storage account and Azure file share
	Enable SMB permission
	Set share permissions
	Mount with "Superuser"
	Set root NTFS permissions
	Mount as a user
	
	Create OU and copy the name like "OU=NoComPWExpire,DC=elansdowne,DC=com"
	

10 - Create a storage account with Public endpoints from selected network (VEN01/WVDsubnet) and create a file share
11 - Follow beneath steps: -

    Select-AzSubscription -SubscriptionId $SubscriptionId 
    
    # Register the target storage account with your active directory environment under the target OU (for example: specify the OU with Name as "UserAccounts" or DistinguishedName as "OU=UserAccounts,DC=CONTOSO,DC=COM"). 
    # You can use to this PowerShell cmdlet: Get-ADOrganizationalUnit to find the Name and DistinguishedName of your target OU. If you are using the OU Name, specify it with -OrganizationalUnitName as shown below. If you are using the OU DistinguishedName, you can set it with -OrganizationalUnitDistinguishedName. You can choose to provide one of the two names to specify the target OU.
    # You can choose to create the identity that represents the storage account as either a Service Logon Account or Computer Account (default parameter value), depends on the AD permission you have and preference. 
    # Run Get-Help Join-AzStorageAccountForAuth for more details on this cmdlet.

    #You can run the Debug-AzStorageAccountAuth cmdlet to conduct a set of basic checks on your AD configuration with the logged on AD user. This cmdlet is supported on AzFilesHybrid v0.1.2+ version.

12 - Assign SMB contributor on file share to WVD users group
13 - Assign SMB elevated admin to potral admin account
14 - Map file share to DC, Create a Profiles folder, Properties, Security, Advanced, Disable Inheritance, levave System, Administrator( ), Creator owner (Remove Full control from it), add wvd users group and assign modify permission to them.
15 - Create a new OU for WVD session host and move all the computers (thos are serving WVD) in this OU.
16 - Extract FSlogix and copy the .adml file in "A:\windows\SYSVOL\domain\Policies\PolicyDefinitions\en-US" and .admx in "A:\windows\SYSVOL\domain\Policies\PolicyDefinitions"
17 - Open Group Policy Management and perform described settings,
     Create a new group policy "FSLogixProfiles"
	 Edit-> Policies->Admintrative Templates- >FSlogix-> Profile Container
	 And Enable settings: Enabled, VHD Location (enable and add file share), Enable and set size, Delete local profile
	 Now move to Contanier and Directory Naming and perform following tasks: Virtual Disk Type (Enable and VHDX), Swap Directory Name component
18 - Now link WVDSessionhost OU to FSLogixProfiles policy
19 - Install FSLogix setup on every session host VM and run "gpupdate /force"
20 - Login session host and check if we have VHDX in fileshare
21 - We can set App masking rule for users now. We have 4 types of App maskign rules:  Hiding rule, Redirect rule, App Container rule, Specify Value rule.
22 - These rules can be assigned to Users, Group, Process, Network Location, Computer, Directory OU, ENV: variable
23 - The rules has two files .fxa and .fxr where FXA contains assignments and FXR contains rules. (C:\prgram files\fslogix\app\rule)
24 - It also ha a compile directory for the rules those are working on the machine (C:\prgram files\fslogix\app\compiled rules)
25 - Rule hierarchy is followed from bottom to top
26 - For deletion of Hostpool, we have to first remove application group associated to it
27 - Once the application group is removed then we can remove/delete the hostpool
28 - The session host (VMs) will be there and have to be deleted manually or through automation

PowerShell code for the same: 


    # Set the host pool variables 
    $hostPoolResourceGroup = 'HostPoolRG'
    $hostPoolName = 'HostPoolName'
    
    # Get the Application Groups
    $appGroups = Get-AzWvdApplicationGroup -ResourceGroupName $hostPoolResourceGroup
    
    # Remove the Application Groups
    foreach ($appGroup in $appGroups) {
        Remove-AzWvdApplicationGroup -Name $appGroup.Name -ResourceGroupName $hostPoolResourceGroup
        Write-Output "Removed: $($appGroup.name)"
    }
    
    # Remove the Host Pool
    Remove-AzWvdHostPool -Name $hostPoolName -ResourceGroupName $hostPoolResourceGroup -Force:$true
    
    # Remove the Resource Group
    # View items in the Resource Group
    Get-AzResource -ResourceGroupName $hostPoolResourceGroup | Select-Object Name,ResourceGroupName
    
    # Optional, be sure nothing in the Resource Group is still in use
    Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name $hostPoolResourceGroup
    
    # View existing Resource Groups
    Get-AzResourceGroup | Select-Object ResourceGroupName

29 - We can also created session host in same host pool using our custom image and for that Registration key is required
30 - Registration key can be created in Hostpool tab and they are only valid from 1 hour to 27 days
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/create-host-pools-powershell#register-the-virtual-machines-to-the-azure-virtual-desktop-host-pool

31 - When we create a VM using custom image it starts with a lower version of agent however this will be updated by WVD in sometime. During this time the VM wouldn't be avilable to accept the sessions.
Note : -  We cannot change the VM sizes in single host pool, all VM should have same size in a hostpool as well as Disk types.
32 - Steps for capturing a general WVD image 

Create a VM
Copy application to Machine
Installation of apps
Copy FSLogix rules to the machine
sysprep, Gen, Out of Box, Shutdown
Capture VM
Create VM using the image in an existing hostpool or we can create a new one for this
It will ask for DC details so it will be added in Domain also define the OU that we have created for WVD session host "OU=WVDsessionHost,DC=elansdowne,DC=com"
