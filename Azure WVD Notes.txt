1 - First, in Azure Active Directory, we built a custom domain.
2 - Verify this in domain provider
3 - Create a VM and promte this as a DC
4 - Propogat custom DNS to VNET
5 - Create a workspace (Place the workspace in another rg for better management and life-cycle)
6 - Create a hostpool and Virtual machine inside it (VM can be created after the hostpool also Hostpool and VM can be in different location)
7 - Assign rights on application groups (create a single group for all WVD users and single group for all similar kinda users) ( For ad sync, use Start-adsyncsynccycle; else, ad sync will take 30 minutes.)

Note : - 
It will sync onmicrosoft.com users if the primary domain is not defined in Azure AD or if the domain name is misspelt during user creation.
To terminate connection requests, we can utilise drain mode in the session host (VM).
